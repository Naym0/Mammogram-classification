# Mammogram-classification
Code for my Master's thesis project

The first two files are for the data cleaning process. In these files, the datasets were explored, visualised, edited and all unnecessary columns dropped. These datasets were then saved on Hugging Face for use. The data cleaning and exploration files are named as follows.
  1.	Mammogram_V1_Dataset
  2.	CBIS_DDSM_Dataset
     
I then have another 2 files in which the cleaned data was imported from my personal Hugging Face repository and used to train the 4 models. These files are named as follows.
  1.	Mammogram_V1_Models
  2.	CBIS_DDSM_Models
     
Each of the notebooks have separate heading sections for different parts of the machine learning process. Sections for the package installations and library imports. A section for the reusable user-defined functions and constants. A section for the dataset imports and ultimately named sections for each of the models to be trained.
